# Games, Coding & the Mini-Max Algorithm

In order to demonstrate the minimax algorithm, I'm replicating the common Tic-Tac-Toe example. I plan to do so in a way that demonstrates a number of concepts, including (but not limited to):
- my pattern of thinking & file structure
- git management
- minimax algorithms
- error handling
- and more
